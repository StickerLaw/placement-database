#### Making a PR:
1. **Fork this repo:** By clicking on the fork button.
2. **Clone your forked repo:** By clicking on clone or download button and copying the url.
3. **Open terminal(Linux)/Git Bash(Windows):** To clone type the following command `git clone <copied url>`
4. **Change Directory:** After the repo is downloaded move into the directory by typing `cd cpp-project`
5. **Set remote:** Your `origin` remote is already set to your fork. Set upstream remote to the original repo by typing `git remote add upstream "<clone/download url of this repo>"`
6. **Create your branch:** Type the following command `git checkout -b <branch name>`. This is to keep the master branch clutter/conflict free. Branch name could be anything for e.g. `git checkout -b develop`.
7. **Open the file:** Make your changes to the opened file(s) and save them
8. **Adding unstaged files:** After saving your changes type the following command `git add .`.
9. **Committing your changes:** To commit the recently added files type `git commit -m "<your commit message>"`. For e.g `git commit -m "changes made"`.
10. **Pushing your changes:** Type the following `git push origin <branch-name>`. You will be prompted for you github id and password. Type them in and press enter
11. **View your changes:** Open your fork on Github and change the branch from master to your recently pushed branch.
12. **Creating a Pull Request(PR):** As soon as you switch the branch you will see the option compare and pull request. Click on that. Fill out the title and description of the PR. Click on *Create pull request* and your changes are sent to upstream.

#### Best Practices:
1. **Rebasing:** To keep your clone up-to-date with the upstream you need to rebase it. Type the following 2 commands `git fetch upstream/master` followed by `git rebase upstream`
2. **Making branches:** Make a separate branch for every new PR.
3. **Codestyle:** Use hard tabs(4 spaces), to maintain uniformity. Comment your code wherever possible.
